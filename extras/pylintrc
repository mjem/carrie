# lint Python modules using external checkers.

# This is the main checker controlling the other ones and the reports
# generation. It is itself both a raw checker and an astng checker in order

# * handle message activation / deactivation at the module level
# * handle some basic but necessary stats'data (number of classes, methods...)
